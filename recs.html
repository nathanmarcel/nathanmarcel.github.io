                    <p>Here are some of the things that I am currently invested in that I highly recommend! </p>
                    <h2>Meditations</h2>

                    <p style="font-size:22px; ">
                        <span class="image right"><img src="images/meditations.jpg" alt="" /></span>I am currently in the middle of <i>The Meditations</i> written by Marcus Aurelius between A.D. 161 and
                        180. They are a collection of personal writings and philosophies written by the Roman emperor himself, translated from Koine Greek to English (I have the Gregory Hays translation, which
                        is apparently the best). What's super fascinating is that despite being the most powerful person of the most powerful nation in the world at the time, Marcus Aurelius is incredibly
                        relatable. He writes about difficulties as trivial as getting out of bed in the morning when it is cold outside and your sheets are warm (he must've been a college student who moved from
                        California to the Midwest), to more abstract philosphies such as man's relationship with fear and fate. Regardless, the book is really engrossing and I highly recommend that everyone read it
                        at some point in their lives. One great quote that I've read so far is:
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size:22px; text-align:center;"> <i>“Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.” </i></p>

                    <h2 align=right>Huberman Lab Podcast</h2>
                    <p style="font-size:22px; ">
                        <span class="image left"><img src="images/huberman.jpg" alt="" /></span>Dr. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist and tenured professor at Stanford University School of Medicine. He started a
                        <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/">podcast</ahref></a> called "Huberman Lab" that launched in 2021 to explain neuroscience in a way that a non-expert could follow and make changes to his or her life. He also brings on other academics
                        to discuss other topics like nutrition, creativity, and mental health. As a college student, it can be hard to consistently cook healthy meals, sleep 8 hours each night, and also be physically active each day,
                        but Dr. Huberman has really simple advice that I have started to apply to my own life. For instance, he recommends viewing sunlight first thing in the morning for 10-15 minutes. This simple
                        protocol stimulates neurons in your eyes that convey to the brain that it is daytime, setting in motion a cascalde of biological functions that wakes your body up faster, provides more
                        energy during the day, and helps you fall asleep quicker at night. Hearing Dr. Huberman plainly explain the science while also providing real studies to back up his points is really enthralling, and
                        following his advice has definitely helped me mentally and physically.

                    <h2 align=right>Simple Chipotle Chicken Recipe</h2>
                    <p style="font-size:22px; ">
                        <span class="image right"><img src="images/chicken.jpg" alt="" /></span>I used to eat Chipotle a lot until I recently discovered that I could make myself their very own chicken on my own 
                        relatively easy and inexpensively. I searched up their recipe and added a little bit of my own touches, but all in all its a very simple recipe. The ingredients are 1-1.5 lbs of chicken (breast or thigh),
                        1.5 tsp salt, 1 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp cumin, 1-1.5 tsp cayenne chili powder (depending on spice level), 4 cloves of minced garlic, 1 tsp olive oil, and around 10 oz of chipotle peppers
                        in adobo sauce. All the spices get blended together with some water to make the marinade, and all you have to do is toss that and the chicken in a container, wait between 1 hour to overnight, 
                        take it out of the marinade and cook on a stove! I also add some chopped cilantro and Thai chilis, and serve it alongside some veggies and rice (and guacamole is a must). This marinade can be used with literally anything
                        (I've experimented with beef, potatos, and more). This recipe saves me a ton of time and money, and eliminates the need to eat at Chipotle since I can make my own (superior) burrito bowls from the 
                        comfort of my own kitchen.
