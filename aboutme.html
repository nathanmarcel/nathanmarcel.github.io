										I’m originally from the SF Bay Area, and I completed my BSME & MSME from Purdue University (Spring 2022/Spring 2023 respectively). 
										Currently, I work at Medtronic in Boston as a part of their surgical robotics division.

										The robot I currently work on at Medtronic is the <a href="https://www.medtronic.com/en-us/healthcare-professionals/specialties/surgical-robotics/robotic-assisted-surgery.html">Hugo RAS System</a>, which is a minimally invasive soft-tissue robot. I’m a part of a the Fleet Management team, where we essentially serve as Hardware Applications/Solutions Engineers, primarily supporting our Boston-based software engineering group. As most of my colleagues in the office are software focused, we help them integrate their projects into the existing Hugo system architecture, ensuring smooth alignment with existing hardware. Every day presents a new challenge, as we’re constantly working on a range of different projects with varied launch dates and versions. I also lead demos of Hugo to visiting customers and senior Medtronic leaders, showcasing its capabilities and applications in minimally invasive surgery. It’s a nice change of pace to my technical work and allows me to connect and share what makes this technology so exciting and impactful.

										I’ve had the chance to work on Johnson & Johnson’s Monarch robot for bronchoscopy and urology and Stryker’s MAKO for orthopedic surgery during my internships. Not to flex (actually a little), but I’m pretty sure that I'm the only person in the world under the age of 25 who’s worked on three different surgical robots. It's a nice little accomplishment, especially since 0 people were going for this record (including myself).

									</p>

									<p style="font-size:25px; color: black;">
										Though it may seem that I'm only interested in surgical robots, my true passion is for any complex device that people interact with. For me, the interaction between the user and the device is the most fascinating and crucial aspect of design. After all, why create something intricate and costly only for people to dismiss it because of an obvious design flaw? The true challenge (and reward) lies in crafting something powerful yet intuitive that people want to engage with.

									<p style="font-size:25px; color: black;">
										I am also extremely passionate about comedy. I performed stand-up in college and do random 5 minute sets around Boston when I can. A goal of mine is to combine my two passions for robotics & comedy. I’ve been working on a series of educational videos to teach the fundamentals of the field without any of the pain I had to endure via a traditional education, such as violently long math proofs, technical jargon, or homework.  It's my true belief that you don't need to be a genius to be a robotics engineer (case in point); you just need to understand some fundamentals and have great communication skills!
									</p>

									<p style="font-size:25px; color: black;">
										A dream of mine is to start a ‘Robotics Institute’, a 1 year program where students work together in teams to build robots. I think that while there is value in pursuing a degree in an engineering discipline, you aren’t taught how the industry works or how to build anything with a practical budget, or at least that isn't the focus of your time at university. (quick rant ->) In reality, you show up to a lecture hall where a professor derives an equation for an hour, then you go home to do the homework where you end up using 6 other equations (which are different than the one the professor covered), and then after a few months you take an exam where you use another 3 different formulas. It’s true that universities do exist more for research than teaching students, but am I really crazy to ask that they teach us more practical things when we pay them tens of thousands of dollars every year to fund their experiments? No?

										I'll wrap this up, I’m not good enough at HTML to know how to make a page full of text look nice. I mostly follow basketball (Warriors) and F1 (Alonso, also I do hate Lando). I 3D print random things around my apartment via my Prusa mk3s+, and I also enjoy cooking (Mexican + Indian fusion is my jam). I'm also pretty nto running and am planning to run a marathon in 2025 (you should check out my cousin's company, <a href="https://therunexperience.com/">the Run Experience</a>, if you're thinking about getting into running)!

										<span class="image right"><img src="images/temp_prusa.jpg" alt="" /></span>I also enjoy working on my personal projects and designs. Last Fall, I purchased and assembled my own 3D printer, an Original Prusa i3 MK3S+. I use it to print out
										random, useful household items that I design, such as paper towel roll holders, a shower caddy, and a scabbard for cooking knives. Shown below are some of my designs, with more
										details on my personal <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/nathanmd140/designs">Thingiverse </a>.
									</p>

									<p style="font-size:22px; ">
										Outside of classwork and projects, I do have other passions (which is tough for an engineering graduate student). I am a 3rd degree black belt
										in taekwondo, and enjoy going running and staying active. As a Bay Area native, I am also a staunch fan of the Golden State Warrios and the SF Giants (no matter where I
										end up moving after college, that will never change). Despite being limited by my budget and resources, I am very passionate about cooking and take pleasure in preparing
										Mexican-Indian fusion for myself and friends.
