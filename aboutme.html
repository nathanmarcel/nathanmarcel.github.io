										I’m originally from the SF Bay Area, and I completed my BSME & MSME from Purdue University (Spring 2022/Spring 2023 respectively). 
										Currently, I work at Medtronic in Boston as a part of their surgical robotics division.
										<figure class="image left" style="margin-right: 15px;">
											<img src="images/me_and_hugo.jpg" alt="Me and Hugo" />
											<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 16px; color: black;">Me and my boy, Hugo</figcaption>
										</figure>
										
									</p>

									<p style="font-size:25px; color: black; ">
										The robot I work on at Medtronic is called the <a href="https://www.medtronic.com/en-us/healthcare-professionals/specialties/surgical-robotics/robotic-assisted-surgery.html">Hugo RAS System</a>, which is 
										a minimally invasive soft-tissue robot. I’ve previously worked on Johnson & Johnson’s bronchoscopy & urology robot Monarch, as well as Stryker’s orthopedic robot MAKO in past internships. 
										(Not) to flex, but I may be one of the only people in the world who have worked on 3 surgical robots in their career (and are under the age of 30).  
									</p>

									<p style="font-size:25px; color: black;">
										I am also extremely passionate about comedy. I performed stand-up in college (and am planning on returning in the near future), and I also try to write comedic poetry now and then (which I would post on this website 
										if I thought it was any good, or funny). I’ve found that these hobbies are a bit unusual for someone in tech. Not to hate on other engineers, but we tend to be relatively serious, fact-driven people.  I, however, 
										am extremely unserious and sarcastic, which leads to situations at work where my colleagues mistake me for an insane person when I’m trying to do a bit about absolute vs relative encoders at lunch (though they may be right).
										A goal of mine is to combine my two passions for robotics & comedy somehow. I’ve been working on a series of educational videos called “robotics without the bullshit” to teach the fundamentals of the field without any of the bullshit I had to endure via a traditional education, 
										such as violently long math/mathematical proofs, technical jargon, or homework. 
									</p>

									<p style="font-size:25px; color: black;">
										Another dream of mine is to someday launch a ‘Robotics Institute’, or a 1-2 year school where students literally just work in teams and build robots. I think that while there is value in pursuing a 
										degree in some engineering discipline (and I definitely don’t regret it), for the most part, you aren’t taught how the industry works or how to build anything practical. (quick rant ->) In reality, 
										you show up to a lecture hall where a professor derives an equation for an hour, then you go home to do the homework where you end up using 6 other equations (which are different than the one the professor covered), 
										and then after a few months you take an exam where you use another 3 different ones. It’s true that universities do exist more for research than teaching students, but am I really crazy to ask that they teach us more practical 
										things when we pay them tens of thousands of dollars every year to fund their experiments? No?
									</p>

									<p style="font-size:25px; color: black;">
										I should probably wrap this up, I’m not good enough at HTML to know how to make this page full of text look nice. I’m also a big basketball fan (yes I’m a Warriors fan, and yes I know they’re not as good as they used to be but the only reason you 
										have the courage to point that out is because you’re not scared of them anymore). I 3D print random things around my place, I really like cooking (Mexican + Indian fusion is my jam), and I know way too much about the extended lore of the Halo series.
									</p>

									

									<!-- <p style="font-size:22px; ">
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/temp_prusa.jpg" alt="" /></span>I also enjoy working on my personal projects and designs. Last Fall, I purchased and assembled my own 3D printer, an Original Prusa i3 MK3S+. I use it to print out
										random, useful household items that I design, such as paper towel roll holders, a shower caddy, and a scabbard for cooking knives. Shown below are some of my designs, with more
										details on my personal <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/nathanmd140/designs">Thingiverse </a>.
									</p>

									<p style="font-size:22px; ">
										Outside of classwork and projects, I do have other passions (which is tough for an engineering graduate student). I am a 3rd degree black belt
										in taekwondo, and enjoy going running and staying active. As a Bay Area native, I am also a staunch fan of the Golden State Warrios and the SF Giants (no matter where I
										end up moving after college, that will never change). Despite being limited by my budget and resources, I am very passionate about cooking and take pleasure in preparing
										Mexican-Indian fusion for myself and friends.
