										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>

									<p style="font-size:22px; ">
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/grad_pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>Originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, I completed my B.S. in mechanical engineering with a minor in
										computer science from Purdue University in Spring 2022. As an undergraduate student, I applied to be a part of a Combined BSME/MSME 5 year program, in which I took graduate level courses my
										senior year that would count towards both my undergraduate and graduate degree. As of right now, I am set to graduate with my M.S. in mechanical engineering
										with a concentration in robotics in Spring 2023.
									</p>

									<p style="font-size:22px; ">
										I am passionate about robotic systems, especially those with medical applications. I have had two previous internships working on two different surgical robots
										(J&J's Monarch Platform and Stryker's MAKO Knee & Hip Replacement Arm). At these internships, I gained practical experience with control systems and mechanical design, such as programming
										controllers to evaluate the performance and flexibility of a robot with Python, as well as designing, fabricating, and then printing a 6-link robotic manipulator using Solidworks, encoders
										and actuators, and used MATLAB for control.
									</p>

									<p style="font-size:22px; ">
										After completing my Mastersâ€™ degree, I intend on working as an engineer somewhere in the field of robotics. The industry is expanding rapidly as robotics are being applied everywhere, and I 
										want to contribute to a company or mission that aims to utilize robots to make the world a better place. Having previous internship experiences in mechanical design 
										and in controls, I have an understanding on how different divisions in robotics companies work together to create a complex end product. My goal is to learn as much as I can 
										about robotics to develop the skills and knowledge needed to become a leader in the field one day.
									</p>

									<p style="font-size:22px; ">
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/temp_prusa.jpg" alt="" /></span>I also enjoy working on my personal projects and designs. Last Fall, I purchased and assembled my own 3D printer, an Original Prusa i3 MK3S+. I use it to print out
										random, useful household items that I design, such as paper towel roll holders, a shower caddy, and a scabbard for cooking knives. Shown below are some of my designs, with more
										details on my personal <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/nathanmd140/designs">Thingiverse </a>.
									</p>

									<p style="font-size:22px; ">
										Outside of classwork and projects, I do have other passions (which is tough for an engineering graduate student). I am a 3rd degree black belt
										in taekwondo, and enjoy going running and staying active. As a Bay Area native, I am also a staunch fan of the Golden State Warrios and the SF Giants (no matter where I
										end up moving after college, that will never change). Despite being limited by my budget and resources, I am very passionate about cooking and take pleasure in preparing
										Mexican-Indian fusion for myself and friends.
